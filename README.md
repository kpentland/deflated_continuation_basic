Basic deflated continuation in Python
====================================================

Aims
----------

The aim of this repo is to:

1. create some standalone scripts that can carry out deflated continuation on a number of simple polynomial and ODE problems. 
2. find multiple roots/solutions to these polynomial/ODE problems using deflated continuation. 


Installation requirements
----------

To re-run the scripts in the repository you'll need to have:

1. Numpy
2. Scipy
3. Matplotlib

Where to start
----------

 - After cloning the repo, simply run the python scripts in your terminal or favourite IDE. 
 
If the above steps don't work, please do get in contact.
